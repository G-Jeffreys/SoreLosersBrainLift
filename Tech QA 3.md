- Okay, then my next question is this: what is the suggested tech stack, and what am I going to have to learn to implement this tech stack?

    - Thought for 41 seconds
    - Below is a practical “shopping list” for the project’s tech stack, followed by a blunt skills-to-learn checklist. Everything stays inside Godot’s comfort zone so you can ship sooner and lean on your free AWS credits only where it actually helps.
- ## 1 Proposed Tech Stack
    - {{[[table]]}}
        - Tier
            - Concrete tools & why they fit
        - **Game client**
            - **Godot 4.x (GDScript)** – 2-D renderer, UI system, and high-level multiplayer API are first-class. Nothing else here gives you so much out-of-the-box for a small team. [Godot Engine documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/networking/high_level_multiplayer.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        - **Networking**
            - Godot’s high-level **ENet** wrappers (`ENetMultiplayerPeer` + Scene Replication). Host-client for “friends” sessions; swap in an authoritative headless build later without rewriting gameplay code. [Godot Engine documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_enetmultiplayerpeer.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        - **Dedicated server (optional)**
            - __Same__ Godot project exported **--headless** and run on an AWS EC2 t3.micro (or Lightsail) behind a single open UDP port. Simple systemd service + log rotation. Guides already exist. [jonandrewdavis.com](https://jonandrewdavis.com/godot-hosting-tips/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Godot Forum](https://forum.godotengine.org/t/headless-version-of-godot-game-for-dedicated-servers/98572?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        - **LLM / persona micro-service**
            - Lightweight **FastAPI (Python)** or **Express (Node)** on another EC2 or Lambda. Communicate via WebSocket for low-latency character prompts.
        - **Persistence**
            - • Prototype: local JSON save-files per user.
                - • Production: AWS **DynamoDB** (schemaless, cheap) keyed by player-ID for stats & progression.
                    - • Backups to S3.
        - **CI / builds**
            - **GitHub + GitHub Actions** using the community “Godot Export” action: auto-exports Windows/macOS/Linux zips each push and optionally pushes to itch.io via __butler__. [GitHub](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/godot-export?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        - **Version control**
            - **Git + Git LFS** for binary assets.
        - **Assets**
            - • Graphics: **Aseprite** (pixel), or Photopea/PS.
                - • Audio: **Audacity**.
                    - • Marketplace: elements.envato.com (import into Godot with Filter = Off for crisp pixels).
        - **Dev tooling**
            - • VS Code + Godot Tools extension or Godot’s built-in script editor.
                - • gdUnit 4 for unit tests.
                    - • Trello/Notion for tasks.
- ## 2 What you’ll need to learn (rough order)
    1. **Godot Fundamentals**
    2. __Scenes, Nodes, Signals, AnimationPlayer, InputMap, Resource system.__
    3. **GDScript**
    4. __Syntax, coroutines (`await`), static typing hints, unit testing.__
    5. **Godot 4 Multiplayer**
    6. __`MultiplayerAPI`, RPCs, authority patterns, handling latency jitter, running two local instances for debug.__ [Godot Engine documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/networking/high_level_multiplayer.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    7. **Headless Builds & AWS Basics**
    8. __Exporting with `--headless`, configuring EC2 security groups, systemd service files, SSH, basic Linux command-line hygiene.__
    9. **XP / Stat Systems**
    10. __Simple ECS-style data (or just plain dictionaries) plus save-load pipelines; balancing curves.__
    11. **CI/CD**
    12. __Git branches, GitHub Actions YAML, artifact uploads, itch.io butler CLI.__ [GitHub](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/godot-export?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    13. **Basic Web Back-end** (only if you keep the LLM stretch goal or need cloud saves)
    14. __FastAPI/Express fundamentals, REST vs. WebSocket, JSON schemas, CORS.__
    15. **Asset Pipeline**
    16. __Sprite slicing, texture channels, audio normalization, Godot import flags.__
    17. **Play-test & Telemetry (later)**
    18. __Log files, simple analytics events, maybe Grafana if you host longer matches.__
- ### Quick sanity check
    - Nothing above requires low-level C++, proprietary plugins, or Unity-style package churn. All tooling is free/open-source (aside from Envato assets) and keeps the cognitive load on one main engine—Godot.
    - Once you’re comfortable with steps 1-3, you can already host friend-only sessions; everything else layers in gradually as polish or stretch goals.
