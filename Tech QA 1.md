- I am working on a game design project and I wanted to get your input on it, especially on the tech side. My current thinking is that I'm going to go with Godot because it is the easiest option available to me, but I need to be sure that it can handle what I'm asking of it (not that I'm creating some high performance high fidelity game or anything like that). Does this layout below make sense, and what other technical considerations am I missing here? *** - Choice of Game Engine: Godot, Phaser 3, or Unity - Godot is the easiest one, not sure why I wouldn't just do this - Phaser 3/Three.js are for realtime browser-based multiplayer - Unity is the hardest/most robust one, it is written in C#. - Yeah, it's probably Godot - Rough Game Idea: turn based card game where you can mess with other players on their turns - Game-within-a-game where your characters are playing a bluffing/trick-taking game like Spades or Skull - Maybe there's a "Ludonarrative Dissonance" mechanic which tracks to what degree your actions match the expressions/desires/intentions of your character (even if it means losing a round) - Either LLM-powered or intelligently structured personas - The more desynchronized you are from your character, the worse the UI gets (to the point that you are losing vital game information) - At low levels, the chat log starts to block your screen, so other players can totally blind you by spamming things in chat - This might warrant character streaming - Consider this a stretch goal, I like the current idea of a game that's ostensibly about a card game but is really about hassling your friends - You have 10 seconds to respond to a table action (without it defaulting to the automatic worst action/forfeit/surrender for the round). During that time, you can leave your seat and hassle the other players - Okay, let's lock in for now on two different interactions - If you just lost a round, the text chat window grows larger and larger on your screen until you either win a round or you step away from the table for a while to calm down (representing your losing your temper/composure as the taunts of your competitors dominate your perception over the actual state of the game) - You can walk relatively far from the table to grab raw eggs. On other people's turns, you can throw eggs at them (limited amount you can carry) and this puts a big egg on their UI, blocking the screen. They have to leave the table and go to a sink or w/e to wash the egg off. - Neither option blocks control or otherwise prevents you from playing the game, you just can't see what cards you have/are on the table, etc. - So, this could really be like a 2d game, pixel art (or whatever), low-res - What is stopping this from being a phone game? - Typing on phones is kind of hard - What is stopping this from being a browser game? - What is stopping this from being a desktop game? - I picture this as a mouse-and-keyboard game. WASD to move around (or arrows), space to select, maybe you can do things with mouse instead. - Let's move forward with Godot provisionally. What are technical demands I am making of Godot which may warrant picking a more complicated system? - Realtime character-streaming of text, tracking player locations, UI-changing character interactions - Turn based card game with timers (every player has, let's say 10-20 seconds to do something) - State (of the deck) is maintained between players - Number of players: 2-4 probably - Randomization of card order - Mouse Control or Keyboard controls (or both, whatever) - Import of extremely simple assets (maybe just mspaint shapes or something) ***

    - Thought for 1m 1s
    - Your outline is totally coherent—you’re already thinking about the right layers (engine → game loop → UX tricks → platform targets). Below are a few “sanity-check” notes on Godot and a short list of additional tech considerations you might want on your radar.
- ## 1 Why Godot probably __is__ enough
    - {{[[table]]}}
        - Requirement
            - How Godot 4.x handles it
                - Caveats / workarounds
        - **2-D scene & pixel art**
            - Godot’s 2-D renderer is still the flagship part of the engine. Tile- and Parallax2D refactors landed in 4.3, so level layout and camera shakes are painless. [GameFromScratch.com](https://gamefromscratch.com/godot-4-3-best-new-features/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
                - Use __integer__ snapping & “lossless” scaling to keep retro pixels crisp.
        - **Low-latency networking for 2-4 players**
            - High-level multiplayer API (ENet/UDP) + Scene Replication; a headless build can act as an authoritative server if you need cheating protection. [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/article/multiplayer-changes-godot-4-0-report-4/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
                - If you want WebRTC or relay servers you’ll need a plugin or a custom module.
        - **Web & mobile export**
            - HTML5/WebAssembly export is one-click; Godot 4.4+ added -O3 + LTO builds for a ~25-40 % FPS bump in browsers. [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/article/upcoming-serious-web-performance-boost/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
                - No threads on Safari iOS yet; big WASM bundles still cost you a 5-10 s cold load on slow phones.
        - **Dynamic UI mischief**
            - The Control node tree lets you resize/animate any panel at runtime, so the “chat window engulfs the screen” gag is trivial. Tween or AnimationPlayer will do the heavy lifting.
                - None—this is a sweet-spot feature for Godot.
        - **Timers & turn logic**
            - `SceneTreeTimer` or `await( get_tree().create_timer(10) )`keep each turn honest.
                - For determinism across clients, start the timer only on the server/host and RPC the expiry time to peers.
        - **Simple assets**
            - Drag-and-drop PNGs, SVGs or BMFont files.
                - Watch out for import defaults that resample low-res art; set __Filter__ = Off.
    - When __might__ you jump to another engine?
        - **Phaser 3 / Three.js** – if you decide the entire experience must live in a browser tab **and** you want download sizes under ~5 MB. You’ll write more boilerplate for animation, camera, and asset pipelines, though.
        - **Unity** – if you pivot to high-fidelity 3-D, need an established ecosystem of networking middleware/analytics, or plan console ports. Otherwise Unity’s licensing and project weight probably aren’t buying you much here.
- ## 2 Extra technical considerations you haven’t listed yet
    - {{[[table]]}}
        - Topic
            - Why it matters for __this__ design
        - **Authoritative vs. P2P**
            - Because deck order and shuffles must be cheat-proof. A headless Godot build running on a cheap VPS can be your arbiter; clients only send input commands.
        - **Reconnect / hot-join**
            - Players will DC in casual games. Decide whether the server keeps table state so someone can hop back in mid-hand.
        - **Random-seed consistency**
            - Generate the seed on the server and RPC it once per hand; every client shuffles locally with the same seed to keep bandwidth low.
        - **LLM hookup**
            - If you keep the “persona-based dissonance” stretch goal, budget latency for API calls (OpenAI, Ollama, etc.). Godot’s `HTTPRequest` node works, but an external micro-service that your clients ping via WebSocket is usually cleaner.
        - **Input abstraction**
            - Throw a `InputMap` profile switcher in your main menu so WASD, arrow keys, gamepads __and__ touch can coexist.
        - **Accessibility**
            - The UI-blocking gags are funny—make sure you offer toggles for photosensitive or low-vision players (even if hidden in “accessibility” settings).
        - **Continuous integration**
            - Godot project files are text-based since 4.x, which helps with Git diffs. Still, set up a simple CI pipeline (GitHub + Godot-export CLI) so every branch spits out a playable HTML5 build.
        - **Testing latency & jitter**
            - Use `NetworkedMultiplayerPeer.set_simulated_latency()` to inject 100-200 ms and ensure your 10-second reaction window still feels fair.
        - **Asset-bundle size budgets**
            - Mobile Safari will kill your page if you exceed ~200 MB memory at runtime. Keep textures packed tightly and consider basis-u compression for large backgrounds.
- ## 3 Suggested next steps
    1. **Prototype the card logic head-less first** inside a plain GDScript scene; write unit tests for shuffling, hand evaluation and timers.
    2. **Add one network peer** and run two local clients so you can stub out RPC calls before you touch UI.
    3. **Layer the “table” scene** (world-space) under a 2-D UI canvas to prove you can drop eggs and still receive click events.
    4. **Throw it on itch.io’s HTML5 sandbox** early—browser feedback will tell you whether Phaser-level download sizes are worth chasing.
    5. **Decide on LLM integration**: in-engine or via a tiny Node.js relay that you can horizontally scale later.
- ### One question back to you
    - Do you expect __random matchmaking__ (i.e., strangers) or is this always “friends join a private lobby”? That single decision will steer how much production-grade netcode and authentication you really need.
    - Happy prototyping—Godot should serve you well here, and you can always migrate up the complexity ladder if the design outgrows it.
